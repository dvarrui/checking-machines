## [2.4.5]

-- FIX: "expect_nothing" was always TRUE when SSH/Telnet connections fails!
   Now when SSH/Telnet connections fails result contains "SSH: NO CONNECTION!"
   So "expect_nothing" will fail.

## [2.4.4]

-- Modify: teuton check output colors and exit codes.
   exit code 0 = check OK
   exit code 1 = check error
-- Fix teuton check docs.

## [2.4.3]

- Fix: "expect_none" without params works as "expect result.count.eq 0"
- Add: "expect_nothing" that works as "expect result.count.eq 0".

## [2.4.2]

- Fix bug with result.grep_v(Array)
